Congratulations! If you've gotten this far, you're ready to start developing your own Flink applications.

Where to go next:

* The [DataStream API Code Walkthrough]({{site.docs}}/getting-started/walkthroughs/datastream_api.html) is a step-by-step tutorial that describes how to create a complete streaming application from scratch.

* You should also explore Flink's relational APIs, which are a convenient way to create Flink applications without writing any Java or Scala code. You can start with the [Table API Code Walkthrough]({{site.docs}}/getting-started/walkthroughs/table_api.html) and then continue your learning with the [Apache FlinkÂ® SQL Training](https://github.com/ververica/sql-training/wiki).

* Last but not least, [Stateful Functions](https://statefun.io) is a powerful new library similar in spirit to serverless computing, but intended for state-centric problems.

And before you put your first application into production, be sure to review the [Production Readiness Checklist]({{site.docs}}/ops/production_ready.html)!
