Congratulations! If you've gotten this far, you're now ready to start developing your own Flink applications.

[DataStream API Tutorial]({{site.docs}}/tutorials/datastream_api.html) is a step-by-step tutorial that describes how to create a complete streaming application from scratch.

You should also explore [Flink SQL]({{site.docs}}/dev/table/index.html), which is a powerful way to create Flink applications without writing any Java or Scala code. [Apache FlinkÂ® SQL Training](https://github.com/ververica/sql-training/wiki) is a great place to get started.

Before you put your first application into production, be sure to review the [Production Readiness Checklist]({{site.docs}}/ops/production_ready.html)!
