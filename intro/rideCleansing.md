If you haven't already done so, you'll need to first [setup your Flink development environment]({{site.baseurl}}/devEnvSetup.html). See [How to do the Labs]({{site.baseurl}}/setup/howto-exercises.html) for an overall introduction to these exercises.

The task of the "Taxi Ride Cleansing" exercise is to cleanse a stream of TaxiRide events by removing events that do not start or end in New York City.

The `GeoUtils` utility class provides a static method `isInNYC(float lon, float lat)` to check if a location is within the NYC area.

### Input Data

This series of exercises is based a stream of `TaxiRide` events, as described in [Using the Taxi Data Streams]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/taxiData.html).

### Expected Output

The result of the exercise should be a `DataStream<TaxiRide>` that only contains events of taxi rides which both start and end in the New York City area as defined by `GeoUtils.isInNYC()`.

The resulting stream should be printed to standard out.

### Getting Started

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>
Rather than following the links in this section, you'll do better to find these classes in the flink-training-exercises project in your IDE. Both IntelliJ and Eclipse have ways to make it easy to 
search for and navigate to classes and files. For IntelliJ, see <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/searching-everywhere.html">the help on searching</a>, or simply press the Shift key twice and then continue typing something like <code>RideCleansing</code> and then select from the choices that popup.

#### Exercise Classes

This exercise uses these classes:

- Java: [com.ververica.flinktraining.exercises.datastream_java.basics.RideCleansingExercise]({{ site.javaexercises }}/basics/RideCleansingExercise.java)
- Scala: [com.ververica.flinktraining.exercises.datastream_scala.basics.RideCleansingExercise]({{ site.scalaexercises }}/basics/RideCleansingExercise.scala)

#### Tests

You will find the test for this exercise in

[com.ververica.flinktraining.exercises.datastream_java.basics.RideCleansingTest]({{ site.tests }}/basics/RideCleansingTest.java)

Like most of these exercises, at some point the `RideCleansingExercise` class throws an exception

{% java %}throw new MissingSolutionException();{% endjava %}

Once you remove this line the test will fail until you provide a working solution. You might want to first try something clearly broken, such as

{% java %}return false;{% endjava %}

in order to verify that the test does indeed fail when you make a mistake, and then work on implementing a proper solution.

Flink's DataStream API features a `DataStream.filter(FilterFunction)` transformation to filter events from a data stream. The `GeoUtils.isInNYC()` function can be called within a `FilterFunction` to check if a location is in the New York City area. Your filter function should check both the starting and ending locations of each ride.
